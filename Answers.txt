- What is the result and implication of removing the code while(t==ticks)? Elaborate on your answer
* Removing the code snippet would allow computeSomething() to finish its execution without having to wait one whole second.
This faster execution would cause the kernel to quickly run out of computeSomething() threads in the readyQ and would
instead jump back to the main() function while waiting for the computeSomething() functions to respawn.
